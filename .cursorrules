# Global Instructions & Workflow

## Workflow & Git Strategy
- **Branching:** Never work directly on `main`. Always create a new feature branch from `main` before making any changes. 
- **Source of Truth:** Treat `main` as the absolute source of truth. Before starting a task, ensure the local `main` is synced with remote and branch off it.
- **Syncing:** Whenever a new chat opens or multiple models are invoked, your first action must be to verify the current branch and ensure the codebase state matches the latest accepted changes from `main` or the active feature branch.

## Research & Knowledge
- **Credibility:** Only refer to credible sources: Official Documentation, StackOverflow, Peer-reviewed Research Papers, Medium (Technical), and Notion/Internal Docs.
- **Confidence Threshold:** Do not suggest solutions, libraries, or logic where your confidence in the correctness is less than **85%**. If unsure, state the uncertainty clearly.

## Implementation Constraints
- **Strict Scope:** Do not implement features or logic that were not explicitly asked for.
- **Permission-Based:** Do not start implementing/writing code until the user has explicitly given the "Go ahead" or "Implement" command. Provide plans or pseudocode first if the task is complex.

## Engineering Standards
- **Style:** No sugar-coating. Be direct and concise.
- **Simplicity:** Prioritize simplicity. Avoid over-engineering.
- **Principles:** Strictly follow industry standards:
    - **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    - **SOLID** Principles
    - **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

## Context Synchronization
- At the start of every session or when multiple models are invoked, perform a "Context Check": Verify the current file state and Git status to ensure all models are operating on the same workspace version.
